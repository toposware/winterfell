/// STARK protocol parameters.

/// These parameters have a direct impact on proof soundness, proof generation time, and proof
/// size. Specifically:
///
/// 1. Finite field - proof soundness depends on the size of finite field used by the protocol.
///    This means, that for small fields (e.g. smaller than ~128 bits), field extensions must be
///    used to achieve adequate security. And even for ~128 bit fields, to achieve security over
///    100 bits, a field extension may be required.
/// 2. Number of queries - higher values increase proof soundness, but also increase proof size.
/// 3. Blowup factor - higher values increase proof soundness, but also increase proof generation
///    time and proof size. However, higher blowup factors require fewer queries for the same
///    security level. Thus, it is frequently possible to increase blowup factor and at the same
///    time decrease the number of queries in such a way that the proofs become smaller.
/// 4. Grinding factor - higher values increase proof soundness, but also may increase proof
///    generation time. More precisely, proof soundness is bounded by
///    `num_queries * log2(blowup_factor) + grinding_factor`.
///
/// Another important parameter in defining STARK security level, which is not a part of [ProofOptions]
/// is the hash function used in the protocol. The soundness of a STARK proof is limited by the
/// collision resistance of the hash function used by the protocol. For example, if a hash function
/// with 128-bit collision resistance is used, soundness of a STARK proof cannot exceed 128 bits.
