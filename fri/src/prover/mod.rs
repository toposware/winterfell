// TYPES AND INTERFACES
// ================================================================================================

/// Implements the prover component of the FRI protocol.
///
/// Given evaluations of a function *f* over domain *D* (`evaluations`), a FRI prover generates
/// a proof that *f* is a polynomial of some bounded degree *d*, such that *d* < |*D*| / 2. The
/// proof is succinct: it exponentially smaller than `evaluations` and the verifier can verify it
/// exponentially faster than it would have taken them to read all `evaluations`.
///
/// The prover is parametrized with the following types:
///
/// * `B` specifies the base field of the STARK protocol.
/// * `E` specifies the field in which the FRI protocol is executed. This can be the same as the
///   base field `B`, but it can also be an extension of the base field in cases when the base
///   field is too small to provide desired security level for the FRI protocol.
/// * `C` specifies the type used to simulate prover-verifier interaction.
/// * `H` specifies the hash function used to build layer Merkle trees. The same hash function
///   must be used in the prover channel to generate pseudo random values.
///
/// Proof generation is performed in two phases: commit phase and query phase.
///
/// # Commit phase
/// During the commit phase, which is executed via [build_layers()](FriProver::build_layers())
/// function, the prover repeatedly applies a degree-respecting projection (DRP) to `evaluations`
/// (see [folding](crate::folding)). With every application of the DRP, the degree of the function
/// *f* (and size of the domain over which it is evaluated) is reduced by the `folding_factor`
/// until the remaining evaluations fit into a vector of at most `max_remainder_size` elements.
///
/// At each layer of reduction, the prover commits to the current set of evaluations. This is done
/// by building a Merkle tree from the evaluations and sending the root of the tree to the verifier
/// (via [ProverChannel]). The Merkle tree is build in such a way that all evaluations needed to
/// compute a single value in the next FRI layer are grouped into the same leaf (the number of
/// evaluations needed to compute a single element in the next FRI layer is equal to the
/// `folding_factor`). This allows us to decommit all these values using a single Merkle
/// authentication path.
///
/// After committing to the set of evaluations at the current layer, the prover draws a random
/// field element α from the channel, and uses it to build the next FRI layer. In the interactive
/// version of the protocol, the verifier draws α uniformly at random from the entire field and
/// sends it to the prover. In the non-interactive version, α is pseudo-randomly generated based
/// on the values the prover has written into the channel up to that point.
///
/// The prover keeps all FRI layers (consisting of evaluations and corresponding Merkle trees) in
/// its internal state.
///
/// # Query phase
/// In the query phase, which is executed via [build_proof()](FriProver::build_proof()) function,
/// the prover receives a set of positions in the domain *D* from the verifier. The prover then
/// decommits evaluations corresponding to these positions across all FRI layers (except for the
/// remainder layer) and builds a [FriProof] from these evaluations. The remainder is included in
/// the proof in its entirety.
///
/// In the interactive version of the protocol, the verifier draws the position uniformly at
/// random from domain *D*. In the non-interactive version, the positions are pseudo-randomly
/// selected based on the values the prover has written into the channel up to that point.
///
/// Since the positions are drawn from domain *D*, they apply directly only to the first FRI
/// layer. To map these positions to the positions in all subsequent layers, the prover uses
/// [fold_positions] procedure.
///
/// After the proof is generated, the prover deletes all internally stored FRI layers.
///
/// Calling [build_layers()](FriProver::build_layers()) when the internal state is dirty, or
/// calling [build_proof()](FriProver::build_proof()) on a clean state will result in a panic.
